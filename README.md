# READMEius.
A website that I worked on during my holidays. Lotta HTML & CSS, Django for the backend, Django ORM + Postgres DB hosted on Render, and Javascript for minimal functionality wherever required.   
Wanted to whip out something quick, a responsive website (Mobile-Optimized) which made me spend sleepless nights yearning for free deployment, but it turned out great at the end.
Forgive the abomination that might be the color scheme, searched for online color palettes instead of UX Design Tips.

The website takes around 30-45 seconds to load for the first time, since the server instance spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity. 
Link's on the sidebar.
